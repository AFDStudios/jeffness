# Vendor Override

Most projects will have a `vendor/` folder containing all the CSS files from external libraries and frameworks – Normalize, Bootstrap, jQueryUI, FancyCarouselSliderjQueryPowered, and so on. Putting those aside in the same folder is a good way to say “Hey, this is not from me, not my code, not my responsibility”.

We often need to override specific aspects of those vendor styles, however. Here we have files named exactly after the vendors they overwrite. For instance, `vendor-override/_bootstrap.scss` is a file containing all CSS rules intended to re-declare some of Bootstrap’s default CSS. This is to avoid editing the vendor files themselves, which is generally not a good idea.
